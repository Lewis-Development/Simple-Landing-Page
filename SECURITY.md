# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Almost every version of this portfolio will remain secure and activitly supported. However, with that being said, it is vital to keep yourself updated with any and all changes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If any security vulnerability is found, no matter how small, please contact myself using my GitHub or my [email address](mailto:contact@lewismackinnon.co.uk). This should not be a regular occurance by any means. Regardless, I will investigate, closely, any reports and respond promptly.
